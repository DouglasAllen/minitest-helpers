This set of test helpers provides functionality similar to
[contest](https://github.com/citrusbyte/contest), but for minitest. The code itself
started from [this gist from Ryan Smith](https://gist.github.com/839034), and
then I added miscellaneous things that other people suggested.

It is mostly here for my own personal use, but feel free to do whatever you want
with it. I might accept interesting patches if you send a pull request.
